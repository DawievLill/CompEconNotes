# Computational Economics Notes

These are notes written in Julia for the computational economics reading group. The notes can be found in the `notebooks` folder. 

There are probably many errors, all of which are my own. It is safe to say that everything is a work in progress ðŸš§

## Outline of topics

1. Floating point arithmetic -- **Complete**
2. Autodifferentiation and linear algebra -- **Complete**
3. Solutions to systems of linear equations -- **Incomplete**
4. Optimisation (unconstrained and constrained) -- **Complete**
5. Function approximation -- **Incomplete**
6. Dynamic programming (deterministic) -- **Incomplete**
7. Endogenous grid method (deterministic) -- **Empty**
8. Stochastic processes -- **Incomplete**
9. Simulation and random numbers **Incomplete**
10. Numerical integration -- **Empty**
11. Dynamic programming (stochastic) -- **Empty**
12. Endogenous grid method (stochastic) -- **Empty**
13. Perturbation methods -- **Empty**
14. Reiter's method -- **Empty**
15. Linear time iteration -- **Empty**
16. BKM algorithm -- **Empty**
17. Sequence space Jacobian -- **Empty**
18. Neural networks -- **Empty**

We will probably not cover all topics during the year, but this is a first run. Future iterations will have more complete notes and include more topics. 

## Resources

Several resources were used in constructing these notes. I relied a lot on code from other people in setting up these notes. Below are links to some of the repositories, books and websites that I found helpful in trying to make sense of it all. These are not presented in any particular order.
