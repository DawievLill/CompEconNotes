# Computational Economics Notes

These are notes written in Julia for the computational economics reading group. The notes can be found in the `notebooks` folder. 

Everything is pretty much a work in progress ðŸš§

## Outline of topics

1. Floating point arithmetic -- **Complete**
2. Autodifferentiation and linear algebra -- **Complete**
3. Solutions to systems of linear equations -- **Incomplete**
4. Optimisation (unconstrained and constrained) -- **Complete**
5. Function approximation -- **Incomplete**
6. Numerical integration -- **Empty**
7. Dynamic programming I (deterministic) -- **Incomplete**
8. Dynamic programming II (stochastic) -- **Incomplete**
9. Time iteration and the endogenous grid method -- **Empty**
10. Projection methods -- **Empty**
11. Perturabtion methods -- **Empty**
12. ODEs and continuous time models -- **Empty**

We will probably not cover all topics during the year, but this is a first run. Future iterations will have more complete notes and include more topics. 

## Resources

Several resources were used in construcing these notes. Below I list some of the ones that I found most useful. 

### Books
