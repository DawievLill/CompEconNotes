# Notes for Computational Economics reading group

The notes can be found in the `notebook` folder. Everything is pretty much a work in progress. 

## Outline of topics

1. Floating point arithmetic -- **Complete**
2. Autodifferentiation and linear algebra -- **Complete**
3. Solutions to systems of linear equations -- **Incomplete**
4. Optimisation (unconstrained and constrained) -- **Complete**
5. Function approximation -- **Incomplete**
6. Numerical integration -- **Empty**
7. Dynamic programming I (deterministic) -- **Incomplete**
8. Dynamic programming II (stochastic) -- **Incomplete**
9. Time iteration and the endogenous grid method -- **Empty**
10. Perturbation methods -- **Empty**
11. ODEs and continuous time models -- **Empty**

Further topics will be added with future iterations of the reading group.
