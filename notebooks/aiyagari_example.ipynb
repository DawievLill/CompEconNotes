As you can see, the interval is continuous and we can't represent an infinite number of values in the computer's memory. So in terms of computation we will likely have to construct some finite grid. You might wonder, what happens then if we have to evaluate a point off this grid? In that case we can use some form of interpolation to give us an approximation of what the points would look like off the grid. This is why we dedicated some time to interpolation before.

    "We see here the vastly greater concentration of gridpoints near the borrowing constraint: out of 50, the first 12 points are less than 1, the next 10 points are less than 5, and so on. Similarly, we see the thinly spaced points near the top: 6 points cover almost the entire span from 1000 to 10,000. With the *double* exponential, the ratio between each pair of successive points grows as we go higher on the grid."
